    """Calculate persistence diagrams for a 1D function.

    Calculates persistence diagrams for a 1D function, following the
    usual Morse filtration. This is equivalent to calculating one of
    the "merge" or "split" trees.

    Parameters
    ----------
    function:
        Input function. Should be an array or an array-like data
        structure that affords iteration.

    order:
        Specifies the filtration order that is to be used for calculating
        persistence diagrams. Can be either 'sublevel' for a sublevel set
        filtration, or 'superlevel' for a superlevel set filtration.

    Returns
    -------
    Persistence diagram of the merge or split tree.
