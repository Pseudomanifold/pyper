    Creates a feature vector by calculating distances to the diagonal

    representation is *stable* but might not be discriminative.

    Parameters
    ----------
    diagram : `PersistenceDiagram`
        Persistence diagram to featurise. Can also be a generic 2D
        container for iterating over tuples.

    Returns
    -------
    Sorted vector of distances to diagonal. The vector is sorted in
    descending order, such that high persistence points precede the
    ones of low persistence.

def featurise_pairwise_distances(diagram):
    """Create feature vector based on stable signatures.

    Creates a feature vector by calculating the minimum of pairwise
    distances and distances to the diagonal of each pair of points.
    This representation follows the paper:

        Mathieu Carri√®re, Steve Y. Oudot, and Maks Ovsjanikov
        Stable Topological Signatures for Points on 3D Shapes

    The representation is stable, but more costly to compute.

    Parameters
    ----------
    diagram : `PersistenceDiagram`
        Persistence diagram to featurise. Can also be a generic 2D
        container for iterating over tuples.

    Returns
    -------
    Sorted vector of distances as described above. The vector is sorted
    in *descending* order.
